If we receive a 401 status code in our API call, it typically indicates an authentication error. This means that the server is requiring authentication to access the requested resource, but the client is not providing valid authentication credentials or is not authenticated at all.

In this case, the part of the code that is most likely not correct is the authentication mechanism. This could be due to incorrect or missing authentication credentials, a mismatch between the authentication type used by the client and the server, or a configuration issue with the authentication system. To resolve this error, we will need to review our authentication mechanism and ensure that the correct credentials and authentication type are being used, and that the authentication system is properly configured.

CSS is used to style and format HTML documents by defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the content.

When making design choices, it's important to consider the overall look and feel of the webpage or application, as well as the user experience and functionality. This includes choosing a color palette, font styles, and layout that are visually appealing and easy to navigate. Additionally, it's important to consider the responsiveness of the design, ensuring that it looks good and functions properly on various devices and screen sizes.

CSS is then used to implement these design choices by defining the styles and properties for each element on the webpage or application. This is done by selecting the elements using CSS selectors and applying styles such as font-size, color, background-color, margin, padding, and more. CSS can also be used to create animations and transitions, further enhancing the user experience.

Overall, the design choices and CSS implementation will depend on the specific project and goals of the application, as well as the target audience and user experience.
